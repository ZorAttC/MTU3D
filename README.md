### Abstract

 Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next in the 3D physical world. 
  Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce **M**ove **t**o **U**nderstand (**MTU3D**), a unified framework that integrates active perception with 3D vision-language learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their environment. . Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 27\%, 11\%, and 3\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA, respectively. MTU3D's versatility enables navigation using diverse input modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images. The deployment on a real robot demonstrates MTU3D's effectiveness in handling real-world data. These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and exploration for embodied intelligence.

### Prepare data
1. download sceneverse data from [scene_verse_base](https://github.com/scene-verse/sceneverse?tab=readme-ov-file) and change `data.scene_verse_base` to sceneverse data directory.
2. download stage1 data for embodied segmentation training from [stage1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigai/MTU3D) and change `data.embodied_base` to download data directory.
3. download feature saved from stage1 from [stage1_feat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigai/MTU3D) and change `data.embodied_feat` to download data directory.
4. download vle data from [vle_stage2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigai/MTU3D) and change `data.embodied_vle` to download data directory.
5. change `embodied_scan_dir` in hm3d-online/*-nav.py to stage1 data directory.
6. download hm3d data from [hm3d](https://aihabitat.org/datasets/hm3d/) and change `hm3d_data_base_path` in hm3d-online/*.-nav.py.
7. download embodied navigation benchmark data from [embodied-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigai/MTU3D) and change `data_set_path` and `navigation_data_path` in hm3d-online/*.nav.py.


### Prepare checkpoints

### Run MTU3D for training
Stage 1 low-level percetpion training
```
python3 run.py --config-path configs/embodied-pq3d-final --config-name embodied_scan_instseg.yaml
```
Stage 2 vision-langauge-exploration pre-training
```
python3 run.py --config-path configs/embodied-pq3d-final --config-name embodied_vle.yaml 
```
Stage 3 navigation dataset specific fine-tuning
```
python3 run.py --config-path configs/embodied-pq3d-final --config-name embodied_vle.yaml data.train=[{specific_dataset}] pretrain_ckpt_path={stage2_pretrained_path}
```
For multi-gpu training usage, we use four GPU in our experiments.
```
python launch.py --mode ${launch_mode} \
    --qos=${qos} --partition=${partition} --gpu_per_node=4 --port=29512 --mem_per_gpu=80 \
    --config {config}  \
```
To debug, use
```
python3 ... debug.flag=True debug.debug_size=10
```

To train, use
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python launch.py --mode accelerate \
    --gpu_per_node=4 \
    --mem_per_gpu=40 \
    --config configs/embodied-pq3d-final/embodied_scan_instseg_cyh.yaml
```
